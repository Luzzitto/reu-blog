# Project A

# Introduction
A. Background information on segmentation models
Machine learning (ML) algorithms have been improving over the last few decade.
ML has a wide variety of application that contributes to fields of medical, military, and more.
This

B. Importance of segmentation in computer vision tasks
Segmentation can have a wide variety application from vehicle autopilot to surveillance system.

C. Challenges and limitations of segmentation models
Segmentation models are not yet perfected. 
The imperfection needs to be addressed and discussed to prevent threat agents in gaining advantage of models.
The severity of improper response can lead to devastating result that can greatly affect consumers.

D. Purpose of the research paper
The purpose of this research paper is to obscure objects in an architecture through various ways and utilizing tools that makes the attack realistic. 
The focus of the research is to find a flaw in the model. 

# Overview
The architecture used for this paper is from YOLO, or [You Only Look Once](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02640.pdf).
YOLO is a "Unified, Real-Time Object Detection"[$^1$](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02640.pdf).
YOLO has been around since 2016 and continued to be developed with an active community.
The latest version of yolo is 8, as of time the paper was written.
The YOLOv8 includes other functions such as detect, segment, classify, and pose (see [ultralytics](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/)). 

## Types of Segmentation
There are various types of segmentation: instance, semantic, and panoptic.
